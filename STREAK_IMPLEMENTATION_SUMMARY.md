# Streak Relationship Endpoint - Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

Based on the streak screen design image provided, I've implemented a comprehensive endpoint that provides all the data needed to build the streak feature for relationships.

## New Files Created

### 1. `/src/routes/streak-endpoints/streakRelationship.ts`
A complete endpoint that returns:
- ‚úÖ **Current combined streak count** (e.g., "100 days")
- ‚úÖ **Both users' individual streaks** with profile pictures and names
- ‚úÖ **Motivational message** ("Complete today's challenge to level up your streak!")
- ‚úÖ **Freeze availability** (0 available - ready for future freeze system)
- ‚úÖ **Monthly activity calendar** showing:
  - Which days each user opened the app
  - Which days both users opened (combined streak days)
  - Day of week, day of month
  - Indicators for today and future dates
- ‚úÖ **Today's completion status** (whether both users opened today)

### 2. `/STREAK_RELATIONSHIP_README.md`
Complete documentation including:
- API endpoint details
- Request/response formats
- How the streak calculation works
- UI implementation examples
- Frontend integration code samples
- Testing instructions
- Future enhancement suggestions

## Updated Files

### `/src/openapi.ts`
- Added import for `StreakRelationshipGet`
- Registered new route: `GET /api/streak/relationship`

## API Endpoint Details

### Request
```
# For a relationship
GET /api/streak/relationship?relationshipId=1

# For a single user
GET /api/streak/relationship?userId=5
```

**Note:** Either `relationshipId` OR `userId` must be provided (not both).

### Response Structure

**For Relationships:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "currentStreak": 2,
    "message": "Complete today's challenge to level up your streak!",
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Gwen",
        "profileImg": "/profile-images/user1.jpg",
        "streakCount": 2
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Peter", 
        "profileImg": "/profile-images/user2.jpg",
        "streakCount": 100
      }
    ],
    "freezeAvailable": 0,
    "calendar": {
      "month": "August",
      "year": 2025,
      "days": [
        {
          "date": "2025-08-01",
          "dayOfMonth": 1,
          "dayOfWeek": "Mon",
          "user1Opened": true,
          "user2Opened": true,
          "bothOpened": true,
          "isToday": false,
          "isFuture": false
        }
        // ... all days of the month
      ]
    },
    "todayCompleted": false
  }
}
```

**For Single Users:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "currentStreak": 15,
    "message": "Complete today's challenge to level up your streak!",
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "John",
        "profileImg": "/profile-images/user5.jpg",
        "streakCount": 15
      }
    ],
    "freezeAvailable": 0,
    "calendar": {
      "month": "August",
      "year": 2025,
      "days": [
        {
          "date": "2025-08-01",
          "dayOfMonth": 1,
          "dayOfWeek": "Mon",
          "user1Opened": true,
          "user2Opened": null,
          "bothOpened": true,
          "isToday": false,
          "isFuture": false
        }
        // ... all days of the month
      ]
    },
    "todayCompleted": true
  }
}
```

## How It Maps to the UI

Based on your streak screen image:

### üî• Top Section - "100 days"
```javascript
data.currentStreak // ‚Üí 100
data.message // ‚Üí "Complete today's challenge to level up your streak!"
```

### üë§ User Cards - "Gwen - 2 days streak" & "Peter - 100 days streak"
```javascript
data.users[0] // ‚Üí { name: "Gwen", streakCount: 2, profileImg: "..." }
data.users[1] // ‚Üí { name: "Peter", streakCount: 100, profileImg: "..." }
```

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Freeze Section - "0 available"
```javascript
data.freezeAvailable // ‚Üí 0
```

### üìÖ Activity Calendar - "AUGUST 2025"
```javascript
data.calendar.month // ‚Üí "August"
data.calendar.year // ‚Üí 2025
data.calendar.days // ‚Üí Array of all days with user activity
```

Each calendar day shows:
- User profile pictures when they opened the app
- Combined indicator when both opened
- Empty for days not opened
- Future days are marked

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Streak Calculation
- **Individual Streaks**: Counts consecutive days each user opened the app
- **Combined Streak**: 
  - For relationships: Takes the minimum of both users' streaks (ensures both are engaged)
  - For single users: Returns individual streak count
- **Backward Counting**: Starts from today or yesterday if not opened today
- **Break Detection**: Stops counting when a day without app open is found
- **Dual Mode Support**: Handles both relationship and single user scenarios

### 2. Complete Calendar View
- Shows entire current month
- Tracks user(s) activity independently
- For relationships: Identifies days when both users were active
- For single users: Shows individual activity (user2Opened is null)
- Marks today and future dates
- Includes day of week for easy reference

### 3. Freeze System Framework
- Currently returns 0 available
- Ready to be enhanced with freeze usage tracking
- Structure in place for "1 freeze per month" logic

### 4. Today's Status
- For relationships: Checks if both users opened app today
- For single users: Checks if the user opened app today
- Useful for showing completion status in UI
- Can trigger different UI states (completed vs pending)

## Testing the Endpoint

### 1. Start the server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test with cURL
```bash
# For a relationship
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/streak/relationship?relationshipId=1"

# For a single user
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/streak/relationship?userId=5"
```

### 3. View in Browser/API Documentation
- Visit: `http://localhost:3000/docs`
- Navigate to "Streak" section
- Try the "Get relationship streak data" endpoint

## Integration with Existing System

This endpoint works seamlessly with the existing streak infrastructure:

1. **Uses** `daily_app_opens` table (already in database)
2. **Works with** `POST /api/streak/record-app-open` (records app opens)
3. **Complements** `GET /api/streak/single-user` (for individual views)
4. **Queries** `relationships` and `users` tables (for user data)

## What's Next?

To complete the streak feature:

### Frontend Implementation
1. Create the streak screen UI matching your design
2. Fetch data from this endpoint when screen loads
3. Display user cards with profile pictures
4. Render the activity calendar
5. Show freeze availability

### Backend Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add freeze usage tracking table
2. Implement freeze activation endpoint
3. Add streak notifications
4. Create milestone achievements
5. Add historical calendar views

## Performance Notes

- ‚úÖ No compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Follows existing code patterns
- ‚úÖ Uses proper TypeScript types
- ‚úÖ Includes comprehensive error handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Calendar queries could be optimized with batch operations
- üí° Consider adding caching for past days

## Example Frontend Usage

```typescript
// React/React Native example
async function loadStreakScreen(relationshipId: number) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${API_URL}/api/streak/relationship?relationshipId=${relationshipId}`
  );
  const { success, data } = await response.json();
  
  if (success) {
    // data.currentStreak ‚Üí Show at top with fire emoji
    // data.users ‚Üí Render user cards with streaks
    // data.freezeAvailable ‚Üí Show freeze section
    // data.calendar.days ‚Üí Render calendar grid
    // data.todayCompleted ‚Üí Show completion badge
  }
}
```
