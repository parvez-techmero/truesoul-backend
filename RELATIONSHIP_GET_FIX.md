# Relationship Get Endpoint Fix - Summary

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Null Check on Relationship**
**Problem**: The code attempted to access `relationship.user1Id` and `relationship.deleted` without checking if the relationship exists first.
**Fix**: Added a null check that returns a 404 error when no relationship is found.

```typescript
// Check if relationship exists
if (!relationship) {
  return c.json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Relationship not found'
  }, 404);
}
```

### 2. **Logic Flow Issue with userId Query**
**Problem**: When `query.userId` was provided without `query.relationshipId`, the code nested all user-fetching logic inside an `if(query.relationshipId)` block, making it unreachable.
**Fix**: Removed the unnecessary nesting and restructured the code to handle both query parameters properly.

### 3. **Inconsistent User Ordering Logic**
**Problem**: The original code had incomplete logic for swapping user1 and user2 based on the requesting user. It checked conditions but the logic was confusing and had unreachable code paths.
**Fix**: Implemented clear, consistent logic:
- When `userId` is provided: The requesting user is always returned as `user1`, and their partner as `user2`
- When only `relationshipId` is provided: Users are returned in their database order
- When relationship is disconnected (`deleted: true`): `user2` is always `null`

### 4. **Proper Disconnection Handling**
**Problem**: The logic for handling disconnected relationships was incomplete.
**Fix**: 
- Only fetch `user2` details when `relationship.deleted === false`
- When swapping users and relationship is deleted, ensure `user2` is always `null`
- Always include `isDisconnect` flag in the response

## Updated Logic Flow

```
1. Validate parameters (at least one of relationshipId or userId required)
2. Fetch relationship:
   - By relationshipId if provided
   - By userId (either user1Id or user2Id) if provided
3. Check if relationship exists → Return 404 if not found
4. Fetch user1 details
5. Fetch user2 details ONLY if relationship is NOT deleted
6. Handle user ordering:
   a. If userId is provided:
      - If userId matches user2Id: Swap users (requesting user becomes user1)
      - If userId matches user1Id: Keep order (requesting user is already user1)
   b. If only relationshipId provided: Return users in database order
7. Return response with isDisconnect flag
```

## Response Examples

### Case 1: Active Relationship with userId
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "user1Id": 2,
    "user2Id": 1,
    "deleted": false,
    "startedAt": "2025-10-08T10:30:00.000Z",
    "user1": {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Requesting User",
      ...
    },
    "user2": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Partner",
      ...
    },
    "isDisconnect": false
  }
}
```

### Case 2: Disconnected Relationship with userId
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "user1Id": 1,
    "user2Id": 2,
    "deleted": true,
    "user1": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Requesting User",
      ...
    },
    "user2": null,
    "isDisconnect": true
  }
}
```

### Case 3: Relationship Not Found
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Relationship not found"
}
```
**HTTP Status**: 404

### Case 4: Missing Parameters
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Either relationshipId or userId must be provided"
}
```
**HTTP Status**: 400

## Benefits

1. **Consistent User Ordering**: The requesting user always sees themselves as `user1` in the response
2. **Proper Null Safety**: No more crashes from accessing properties of undefined relationships
3. **Clear Disconnection Handling**: Disconnected relationships properly hide partner information
4. **Better Error Messages**: Proper 404 responses when relationships don't exist
5. **Simplified Logic**: Removed nested conditions and unreachable code paths
6. **Maintainability**: Code is now easier to understand and modify

## Testing Recommendations

Test the following scenarios:
1. ✅ Get relationship by relationshipId (exists)
2. ✅ Get relationship by relationshipId (not found)
3. ✅ Get relationship by userId (user is user1 in DB)
4. ✅ Get relationship by userId (user is user2 in DB)
5. ✅ Get active relationship by userId
6. ✅ Get disconnected relationship by userId (should return user2: null)
7. ✅ Call with neither relationshipId nor userId (should return 400)
8. ✅ Get relationship by both relationshipId and userId (should use relationshipId)
